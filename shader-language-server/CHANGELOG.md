## [unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-25

This new version features a lot of changes that should drastically improve performances on huge shader codebase, memory usage and behaviour of variant & updates. There was also some redesign with the architecture to handle this and make the API more friendly to use.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where regions were not displayed when diagnostics were disabled.
- Fixed an issue with file using variant context missing some symbols behind include guards.
- Fixed and improved the way symbols caching are handled.
- Fixed a warning when hovering a field return by a method. 
- Fixed an issue whith HLSL database where its missing some parameters in Texture objects.
- Fixed an issue with include handler pushing include from inactive region on stack, which could end up including file from a wrong folder.
- Fixed intrinsics depending on requirements that were ignored.
- Fixed some missing diagnostics clear when files are closed.
- Fixed some dependency files not being cleared from memory when main file was closed.
- Fixed an issue with updating a variant dependency that would cause it to clear inactive regions.
- Fixed diagnostic not being cleared when passing from error state to non error state.
- Fixed an issue where a variant file not opened prevent using the feature.
 
### Changed

- There can be only **one** variant at a time to avoid file randomly picking a variant.
- ValidationParams & SymbolParams have been merged into a single struct ShaderParams.
- Update messages are now handled asynchronously, which avoid messages from getting queued when caching take a lot of time. This can increase server speed drastically in huge codebase.
- Reporting cache update through progress report notification.
- Validator is now behind a solid struct instead of a trait.
- Main functions are now sharing common entry point for uniformity.
- Reduced memory usage of the server.
- Changed API entry point.
- Clean code, moved files & renaming

### Added

- Added Dxc builtins macros to symbols.
- Added advanced symbols filterings for intrinsics. Extensions should be now easy to add for GLSL in an upcoming release.
- Added test for each shader stage.
- Added check for which shader stage is supported in Validator
- Added command line argument for shader-language-server to pass configuration on startup.

## [0.8.2] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash when DXC fail to instantiate. Fallback to glslang for validation instead.
- Fixed an issue with dxil dll loading on Linux as dxcompiler.so seems to load it from path while we create it from absolute path.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with invalid position computed using UTF8 characters
- Fixed a crash when triggering completion on position at start of line due to invalid line computation from byte offset.
- Updated shader-sense-cli Cargo.toml for a crates.io release.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-08-03

### Added

- **Struct completion** features has been hugely improved. You will now benefit of structure field completion in HLSL & GLSL.
- HLSL database now include methods for Texture & Buffer Objects to be used along struct completion.
- Added **formatting** for HLSL & GLSL code through clang format (for full & partial formatting). Support for a .clang-format configuration file.
- Added an option for **DXC SPIRV** support to remove warning related to SPIRV (shader-validator.hlsl.spirv).
- Every field of the config is now optional for third party client and server will not crash if its missing some.
- Improvement on caching and dependencies handling aswell as performances.
- Add a CLI tool for validating shaders.

### Fixed
- Fix an issue where DXC warning were not displayed if no error was found.
- Fix an issue where DXC was picking globally accessible DXC instead of bundled one.
- Fix an issue with region missing some defines.
- Fix an issue with dirty files being wrongly tracked.
- Fix an issue with HLSL array variable in struct not being captured.

## [0.6.2] - 2025-06-06

### Fixed

- Fix an issue preventing dependencies to be updated correctly when opened in editor.
- Add guard to prevent crash on include stack overflow

## [0.6.0] - 2025-05-03

### Added

- Variant now have context. When you open a dependency of the variant, it will have its context from the first place its included. It means it will have macro definition passed from context.
- Symbols now store directly there include data which simplify a lot the way we interact with it. More logic moved from shader-language-server into shader-sense directly.
- Fix performance issues with huge diagnostic parsing.
- Update opened files when a dependency file is being updated.

### Fixed

- Better handling of updates with improved performances
- Fix an issue where editing a file would remove symbols from included files from all providers.


## [0.5.4] - 2025-03-26
